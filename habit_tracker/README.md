# Pixela Habit Tracking App (HTTP Requests & Headers)
Completed on Day 37 of 100 Days of Python

A Python-based habit tracking application built using the Pixela API, created primarily to understand how HTTP requests work in practice. The project focuses on making authenticated API calls using custom HTTP headers.

The project demonstrates the use of different HTTP methods: creating resources with `POST`, modifying existing data with `PUT`, and removing data with `DELETE`. Dates are generated dynamically using Python’s `datetime` module and formatted to match the API requirements.

Skills learned: making authenticated HTTP requests with custom headers, using REST API methods (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), sending JSON payloads with `requests`, and handling date formatting with `datetime`.
