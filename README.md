# Python Projects - Post-Intermediate

A collection of post-intermediate Python projects focused on building applications that interact with external services, automate real-world tasks, and work with live data from the web. This repository emphasizes moving beyond local programs into networked, API-driven, and automation-based workflows.

Each project integrates multiple concepts together, with a strong focus on reliability, external dependencies, and real-world use cases.


## Topics covered

* Working with APIs and RESTful services
* Making HTTP requests using the `requests` module
* Sending query parameters, headers, and payloads
* API authentication and secure credential handling
* Sending SMS and notifications using third-party services
* Web scraping and data extraction with Beautiful Soup
* Browser automation using Selenium WebDriver
* Handling dynamic web content and page interactions


## Project style

* Scripts and automation-focused applications
* Integrations with external APIs and web services
* Data extraction and processing from live websites
* Browser automation for tasks not accessible via APIs


## Purpose

This repository documents the transition from standalone Python applications to systems that interact with the outside world. The projects focus on practical automation, API consumption, and web-based data handling.
