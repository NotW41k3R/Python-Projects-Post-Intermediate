# Cookie Clicker Automation Bot (Selenium WebDriver)
Completed on Day 48 of 100 Days of Python

A Python script that automates gameplay in Cookie Clicker using Selenium WebDriver. The bot continuously clicks the main cookie to generate cookies and periodically checks for available upgrades, purchasing the most expensive unlocked and enabled product every few seconds. The script runs for a fixed duration and reports the final cookies-per-second (CPS) value at the end.

This project was built to practice browser automation fundamentals, including interacting with dynamic web pages, handling frequently changing DOM elements, and implementing time-based decision logic. The automation logic focuses on state-aware actions ensuring upgrades are only purchased when they are actually available.

Skills learned: Selenium WebDriver basics, locating elements using ID, XPath, and CSS selectors, handling dynamic and frequently updating DOMs, understanding element state, implementing time-based polling and control loops, practical limitations of Selenium for real-time, client-side applications
