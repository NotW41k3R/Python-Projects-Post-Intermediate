# Automated Gym Class Booking System (Selenium WebDriver)
Completed on Day 49 of 100 Days of Python

A Python script that automates logging in and booking gym classes on a web-based scheduling system using Selenium WebDriver. The bot performs a resilient login with retry handling, navigates to the class schedule, and automatically books or waitlists all available classes on selected day/s of week. After execution, it verifies the final bookings via the “My Bookings” page and prints a summary of results.

Skills learned: Selenium WebDriver fundamentals, handling dynamic and re-rendered DOM elements, retry logic with failure detection, conditional UI automation, and understanding the limitations of UI-based automation compared to API-driven solutions.
