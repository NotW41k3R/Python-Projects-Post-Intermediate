# Automated Birthday Wisher and Monday Quotes
Completed on Day 32 of 100 Days of Python

A Python automation script that sends personalized birthday emails based on a list of birthdays stored in a CSV file. The script checks the current date, matches it against stored birthdays, selects a random letter template, personalizes it with the recipient’s name, and sends the email automatically via SMTP.

Email credentials are handled securely using environment variables, and letter templates are loaded dynamically from local files. This project demonstrates real-world automation involving date-based logic, file handling, data processing, and external service integration.

Skills learned: working with dates and time using datetime, reading and processing data with pandas, SMTP email automation, secure credential handling using environment variables, and building time-dependent automation scripts, Running python scripts on cloud using python anywhere.
